# SIGame in React with TypeScript

Hello, there!

## The game is in dev stage now!

SIGame is my project for college's practice work. Game based on the Russian tv show of the same name. I changed some rules by my will. You may acquaint with the game on official YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@Svoya_igra

## Main rules

-There are from 3 to 5 teams or solo players

-Teams decides by own who will play first

-First team pick the question from grid, telling the topic of the question and amount of scores the question is playing for to the host

-The host reveals the question to the players

-The question is playing for 10 seconds

-Any team (or solo player) can answer the question by raising they hand (who do it first answer the question), while the team is answering, game is paused, team has 10 seconds to answer

-If team (or solo player) doesn't answer or give wrong answer they lose that amount of scores the question is playing for and any other team can answer the question

-If team (or solo player) gives right answer they gain that amount of scores the question is playing for and they are picking next question

-If nobody answer the question right nobody lose or gain scores and the team who the last picked the question picked again

-Wins the team with the biggest score

## I hope I explained rules pretty clearly, but you can understand the game by watching or playing it by your own. Good Luck!
